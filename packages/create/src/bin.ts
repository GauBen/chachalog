The following files were created:
${[
	".chachalog/config.mjs",
	manager === "nothing" && ".chachalog/.version",
	features.includes("comment-pr") && ".github/workflows/comment-pr.yml",

You can now review and edit them to fit your needs.

If you are using TypeScript, install '@chachalog/types' as a dev dependency to get type support in your config file.
