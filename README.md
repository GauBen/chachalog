# ðŸ¦œ Chachalog

The modern changelog generator.

## Workflow

Here's what to expect when using Chachalog:

1. Create a new branch for your changes, as you normally would.

2. Open a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.

3. **Chachalog will comment your pull request to invite you to write a changelog entry.**

4. Add a changelog entry by clicking the link in the comment. This entry also contains the expected version bump associated with your changes.

5. When ready, merge your pull request.

6. **Chachalog will collect all changelog entries and open a pull request.** This pull request will contain the updated changelog and the version bump.

7. When your release is ready, merge the changelog pull request.

8. **Chachalog will create a new release with the updated changelog.**

9. Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
